# tool-fbin2asc

This repo contains the program for a converter: From a binary-type (stream output from Fortran90 programs) to an ascii-type. This is used to generate plots (e.g. by Gnuplot) by temporarily *expanding* the *compressed* data for saving the storage. This is also used with a batch script for generating animations.

TODO: Add a description about its fundamental interface.

Notice: This repo have not been maintained for a long time. Makefile especially does not work properly. But the program itself *probably* works correctly.
